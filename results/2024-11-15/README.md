This directory has results for simulations where all variables were fixed except for the selection coefficient and sweeps were sampled one generation after fixation

I think these simulations included a mistake - I had a population of 1000 for burn-in, but then increased it to 5000 after burn-in, which means I had a population that recently expanded.
